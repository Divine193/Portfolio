# 📊 Insurance Claims Fraud Detection And Risk Analysis 

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing insurance claims data to understand risk patterns, claim behavior, and potential financial impact.
It combines actuarial concepts with data analytics techniques to explore how claims occur, and which claims are likely to be accepted or denied.

This is a flagship portfolio project aimed at demonstrating risk thinking, statistical analysis, and business insight.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of insurance claims data.
- Analyze claim status, claim amount and premium amount and how they relate to each other.
- Identify customer or policy  characteristics associated with higher risk.
- Apply actuarial thinking style to real world problems.


## ❓ Key Questions 

- What does the claims data look like overall?

- which variables appear most related to claim status?
  
- The approval rate and denial rate of the insurance company?

- How concentrated are claims among certain customer groups?

- which customer segments have the most approval rate and which had the demial rate?


## 📕 Dataset - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mastmustu/insurance-claims-fraud-data/data" target="_blank"> Insurance Claims </a>

### Data Overview

This dataset contains insurance poicyholder and claim information used to analyze factors influencing insurance claim approval dcisions.

### Data Source

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and represents a simulated insurance claims dataset for analytical and educational purposes.

### Dataset Size

The dataset contains 10,000 records with 38 columns

### Key Columns:

  - `poiicy_id` : Unique identifier for each policy
  - `age` : Age of the policyholder
  - `education_level` : Highest education level  attained
  - `insurance_type` : Insurance type bought by the policyholder
  - `premium_amount` : Premium amount paid by the policyholder
  - `claim_amount` : Amount claimed by the policyholder
  - `any_injury` : indicates whether injuries occurred
  - `incident_state` : State where the incident occurred
  - `claim_status` : Claim outcome(Accepted or Denied)

The dataset containd missing values, inconsitent categorical entries, and class imbalance, which were handled during data cleaning and preprocessing.



## 🧠 Methods & Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Descriptive Analytics and Visualizations
- Basic risk metrics
  
##  Tools(Planned)
- Python(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PoweBI(Later for dashboard)
