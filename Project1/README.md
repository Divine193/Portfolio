# 📊 Insurance Claims Risk Analysis 

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing insurance claims data to understand risk patterns, claim behavior, and potential financial impact.
It combines actuarial concepts with data analytics techniques to explore how claims occur, and who is more likely to file claims

This is a flagship portfolio project aimed at demonstrating risk thinking, statistical analysis, and business insight.


## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of insurance claims data.
- Analyze claim amount and premium amount and how they relate to each other.
- Identify customer or policy  characteristics associated with higher risk.
- Apply actuarial thinking style to real world problems.


## ❓ Key Questions 

- What does the claims data look like overall?

- Which variables appear most related to claim occurrence?

- How concentrated are claims among certain customer groups?

- which customer segments are the most risky

## 🧠 Planned Analysis(Initial Scope)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Descriptive Analytics and Visualizations
- Basic risk metrics
  
##  Tools(Planned)
- Python(Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PoweBI(Later for dashboard)
